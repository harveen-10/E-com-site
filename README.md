## SHOP SPHERE

# Description
This project is a demonstration of an e-commerce website designed to simulate the online shopping experience. It features a robust user system, allowing visitors to sign up for an account or log in to access personalized features. Upon authentication, users are directed to the home page where they can browse a curated selection of products.

Users can easily add products to their virtual cart and proceed to the cart page to review their selections. The project includes a mock checkout process, completing the end-to-end user journey typical of e-commerce platforms.

HOME PAGE: A welcoming landing page that displays a variety of products.

SHOPPING CART: A dynamic cart system where users can add products, adjust quantities, or remove items. The cart updates in real time as items are added or changed.

SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY: Implemented a search bar where users can enter keywords to find specific products.

FILTER: Allow users to filter products based on categories (e.g., clothing, electronics, home decor).
